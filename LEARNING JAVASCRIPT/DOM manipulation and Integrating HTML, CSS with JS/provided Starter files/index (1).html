    <h2>Creation & Development</h2>
    <p id="description">
      In 1962, with the success of the Fantastic Four, Marvel Comics editor and
      head writer Stan Lee was casting for a new superhero idea. He said the
      idea for Spider-Man arose from a surge in teenage demand for comic books
      and the desire to create a character with whom teens could identify. As
      with Fantastic Four, Lee saw Spider-Man as an opportunity to "get out of
      his system" what he felt was missing in comic books. In his autobiography,
      Lee cites the non-superhuman pulp magazine crime fighter the Spider as a
      great influence, and in a multitude of print and video interviews, Lee
      stated he was further inspired by seeing a spider climb up a wallâ€”adding
      in his autobiography that he has told that story so often he has become
      unsure of whether or not this is true.

      <p>
        Here we will see how to access the various objects present in the DOM
        tree and to manipulte them
      </p>
      <p>
        First of all, when we inspect any page and go to the console section, we
        cant print any object of the DOM tree using the console.dir() function
      </p>
      <p>
        When we print the 'document' object which is the root node of the DOM
        tree, we get all the properties of this object one of which is the 'all'
        property which has all the components and elements present inside of it
        in numbered fashion i.e. it is a collection and we can access any
        particular object (say h1) by using it's index just like we do in the
        case of arrays
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon accessing a particular object, we get the list of all the
        properties of that paerticular object and we can access andmake changes
        to any one of them
      </p>
      <p>
        For example if the h1 tage is at the 8th index inside the 'all' section
        of the document object, and we want to change the inner text (which is
        basically the text written inside that h1 tag), we can write the JS code
        as follows :
      </p>
      <p>document.all[8].innerText = "Your new text"</p>
    </div>
    <script src="app.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
