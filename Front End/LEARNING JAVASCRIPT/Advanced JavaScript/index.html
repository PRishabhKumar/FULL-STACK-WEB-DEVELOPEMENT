    <h1>Call Stack in JS</h1>
    <p>
      Call stack in JS is basically a data structure which stored information
      about function class made through JS. Every time a new function call is
      made, it get added into the stack and once the function execution is over,
      it gets removed from the stack
    </p>
    <p>
      For example if we have a function called one() which simply returns '1',
      and we have two other functions as two() and three() which return '2' and
      '3' repectively but not directly. The function tow() makes two calls to
      the one() function and returns the result of addition of the function
      calls. Similarly, the function three, makes a call to the functions two()
      and one() and adds their resluts to return 3.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here when we call the function two(), it gets added in the call stack and
      the control goes inside the two() function. here when the one() function
      is called twice, first one instance of one() gets added in the stack but
      since it simplyt returns 1, its execution takes negligible time and hence
      the instance is almost instantly removed from the stack as well. Same
      process is repeated for the second call to one().
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, the execution of the controls moves back to the two() function
      and since all the work to be done by this function is also over, the
      execution comes to an end and the call to two() which was initially pushed
      into the stack is also removed, making the stack empty
    </p>
    <br /><br /><br />
    <p>
      Similarly when the three() function is called, it is added to the stack
      and the cont\rol transfers to the three() function wihhc in turn has a
      function call first to two() and then to one(). So first, the call is made
      to the two() function which is added to the stack. Once the control
      reaches inside the two() function, it encounters two calls to one() which
      are also added to the stack and the same process is repeated as mentioned
      above. Once the execution of both the one() functions and the two()
      function comes to an end, they are removed from the stack and the control
      is again transfered to three(). Here again a call to one() is encountered
      and hence it is added to the stack and the control goes there. ONce the
      execution of the one() function is over, it is removed from the stack. Now
      the control comes back to three() and after returing the value, the
      exeuction of three() is also over and hence it is also removed from the
      stack, making the stack empty again.

    <h1>Single-threaded nature of JS and how browser helps overcome it</h1>
    <p>
      Programming languages are either single-threaded or multi-threaded. Single
      threaded languages are those that can execute only one command at a time
      whereas multi-threaded languages can execute multiple instructions at the
      same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      JS is a single-threaded language. Therefore if you give 6 lines of code
      where you are delcaring a varaible, printing it, doing the same for
      another varaible, then calculating the sum of the two varaibles and then
      prinitng it, each and every instruction will be executed one-by-one with a
      certain delay, which we are not able to visualize because it is very small
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose, we give a code where we are passing a function called hello()
      inside the setTimeout() function and giving the delay as 2s and after
      that, we are giving another normal console.log() printing your name, we
      will see that upon running the code, your name appears instantly and after
      2seconds teh hello gets printed. If JS is a single-threaded language then
      how is it able to execute another instruction before the completion of the
      previous one ?? Ideally, JS should wait for 2 seconds, then print the
      hello and then your name but so is not the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one that helps JS overcome the limitations dur to it's single-threaded
      nature is the browser. Web browsers are generally coded in multi-threaded
      languages like C++ or Java. So when such a situation is encountered, the
      browser takes the hello() function (which is passed as callback in the
      setTimeout() function) and stores it within itself so there does not exist
      a function called hello() for JS so it executed the next statement that
      prints the name and after 2 seconds, the browser returns the hello()
      function back to JS and adds it in its call stack and hence the function
      now exists for JS and it executes it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two types of natures of programming languages i.e. synchronous
      and asynchronous. Synchronous is when each and every line executes one
      after the other in order. Asynchronous is when this does not happen.
      Although along with a single-threadedness, JS is also synchrnous in nature
      but in many cases it behaves asynchronously which is very important to
      know about.
    </p>
    <h1 id="ayncJS">Asynchronous nature of JS</h1>
    <p>
      Suppose we create a function in JS where we are accessing a heading and
      changing its colour using JS. Here, if we want to change the colour of the
      heading after a specific time say 2s to any colour say orange, and we want
      to colour to change to red after 2s of the colour changing to orange, then
      we can create a function which accepts 2 parameters i.e. the desired
      colour and the delay after which the colour is to be changed and we can
      create a simple setTimeout() function to change the colour after the given
      delay. Now if we give the initial delay as 2s and we want the colour to
      change to red 2s after the colour was changed to orange, we will have to
      call the function again this time with the colour 'red' and the delay as
      4s (2+2) and this can go on. Suppose we want to keep changing the colour
      for 1000 times each time with a different colour and 2s after the last
      colour change was made, then it is not a very ideal appraoch to call the
      function 1000 times each time calculating the new delay to be passed to
      the function. To solve this, we can also add a parameter say nextColor, in
      the changeColour() function which will basically accept a function which
      instructs the next colour change. Now to implement this, we can call the
      function for the first time like changeColour("orange", 2000,
      ()=>{changColour("red", 2000)}).
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the function passed to the nextColor formal parameter is nothing but
      another call function to the same changeColour() function but this time
      with a new colour and delay of 2s, so in the main changeColour() function,
      this entire code of changing the colour and executing the funciton passed
      to nextColor happens after the given delay (here 2s) and hence when we
      pass another call of the same function again with a delay of 2s and a
      different colour, then the colour change to red will happend after
      2000+2000 = 4000ms i.e. 4s. This is how we can chain function calls to
      achieve the desired objective. However this approach looks very confusing
      to someone who views the code for the first time and hence is not very
      recommended although such callbacks are actually found in industrial
      websites as well. To solve this issue, we use the concept of promises and
      async and await keywords.
    </p>
    <h2>Promises in JS</h2>
    <p>
      Promise is actually an object in JS which has its success and failure
      cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose we are writing a function in JS to store a data in the database.
      Now the completion of this work depends on lets say the internet speed
      which is a random varaible defined by us here and we will set the cases
      when the operation will be successfully completed and when it will fail.
      Now if we follow the same method of chaining callbacks as in the case of
      changing the colour of the heading then it becomes very confusing to
      comprehend as well as to debug the code. For this, we use promises and
      more information on this is given in app.js
    </p>
    <h2 class="asyncAwait">Async functions</h2>
    <p>
      Async functions are spefical types of functions which by default return a
      promise even when we dont explicitly write the return keyword. Any normal
      function can be converted to an async function by writing the 'async'
      keyword before the 'function' keyword.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next we have another very important keyword i.e. the await keyword which
      is basically used to wait till the current async function call is
      completed before going to the next function call.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      <i
        ><u
          >Note: The await leyword can only be used inside an async function</u
        ></i
      >
    </p>
    <h2>Miscellanous</h2>
    <p>
      We can add additional information in our URL while searching for anything
      or making an API call by maing use of the wuery string. Suppose we write
      google.com in the search box so we will be taken to the google search
      engine and from there we can search for any specific thing like apple,
      mango etc etc. However if we directly want to search for say apple without
      first going to the Google page and then typing in the search box, we can
      write the URL as follows :
    </p>
    <p>https://www.google.com/search?q=mango</p>
    <p>
      For a multi-word wuery, each word is written one after the other with '+'
      between them as shown below :
    </p>
    <p>https://www.google.com/search?q=Apple+phone+company</p>
